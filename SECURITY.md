# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not report security issues via public GitHub issues or pull requests.

Preferred: use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting for this repository:
- Repo page → `Security` → `Report a vulnerability`

If private reporting is not available for your account, contact the maintainers privately.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- the `mathilde-binary-transport` crate and code in this repository
- the `MATHLDBT` format encoder/decoder and optional compression helpers

## Supported versions

Only the latest released version is supported with security fixes.

## Disclosure expectations

We will:
- acknowledge receipt when we can reproduce the report
- coordinate a disclosure timeline with the reporter when appropriate

We do not run a public bug bounty program.
